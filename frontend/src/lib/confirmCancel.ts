/** Ask before cancelling, because cancel deletes the part-transferred data.
 *
 * That deletion is the point of cancel — it is what stops a cancelled 50 GB
 * upload sitting on a seedbox quota — but it means one click can throw away
 * hours of transfer. The queue dock calls the button "Cancel"; Deck and
 * Timeline call it "Skip", which sounds like "leave it for later" and is the
 * more dangerous wording of the two.
 *
 * Nothing transferred yet means nothing to lose, so those cancel straight
 * away rather than nagging. When there is progress at stake the dialog names
 * the alternative, since Pause is usually what was wanted.
